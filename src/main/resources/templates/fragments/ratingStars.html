 Template for the rating stars.

- n: defines the pre-chosen difficulty.

- inputName: name of the input.

- idSuffix: Workaround, so we can use multiple ratingStars on the same HTML page. This suffixes the <label> ids
			so that we don't get duplicate ids. We cannot use <label><input></label> instead because this
			is not compatible with the CSS in ratingStars.css.

  see also http://lea.verou.me/2011/08/accessible-star-rating-widget-with-pure-css/ and ratingStars.css
