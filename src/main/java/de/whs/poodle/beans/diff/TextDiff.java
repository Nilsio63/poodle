/*
 * A TextDiff object represents a single difference in a text. A diff over
 * a whole text is represent by a list of TextDiffs.
 *
 * For example, if the Text "aabbcc" is changed to "aaddcc", the list of
 * TextDiffs would look like the following:
 *
 * - EQUALS aa
 * - DELETE bb
 * - INSERT dd
 * - EQUALS cc
 *
 * This is more or less a wrapper for the "Diff" object in the
 * google-diff-match-patch library which doesn't comply with any
 * Java conventions and makes it impossible to use it in the View
 * layer (due to missing Getters).
