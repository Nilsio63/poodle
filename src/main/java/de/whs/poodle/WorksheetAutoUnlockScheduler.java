/*
 * This Scheduler takes care of automatically unlocking worksheets
 * that have an "unlock at" date set by the instructor. It checks every
 * RATE_MS milliseconds for worksheets to be unlocked and unlocks them.
 *
 * This may cause a slight delay between the specified unlock time
 * and the actual unlocking, but this is negligible. In order to guarantee
 * the unlocking at the exact specified time, we would have to create
 * a timer for each worksheet. However, this would be complicated and error prone
 * since you have to keep track of the timers, make sure they are always in sync with the
 * database and restore them on server restart.
